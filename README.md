# QB_LinAlg_Exercises
List of tests from Quantiative Byte's linear algebra in C++ playlist.

Besides directly replicating the results, there'll be some attempts at expanding the resources into
other, more exotic theorems in multilinear settings, the first of which is by introducing a simple
"rotor" class for rotations, rather than standard quaternionic multiplication.

Changes from QB's features
===
In the Vector Class:
- Reversal operator
- Projection operator
- Hadamard Product

In the Rotor Class (Not finished):
- Basic rotors
- Basic motor
- Basic spinor (Rotation + dilation)

Theorems tested:
- None yet
